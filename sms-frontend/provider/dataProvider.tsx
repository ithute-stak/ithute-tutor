/*
 * IMPORTANT TENANT RULE
 * ---------------------
 * Do not filter operational data with auth.user.school_id here. That field is
 * only a legacy compatibility bridge and is not the selected school for a
 * multi-school user. All collection APIs are already scoped by the server's
 * verified active SchoolContext. School switching performs a hard reload, so
 * Redux state is rebuilt from the newly selected workspace.
